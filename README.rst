Introduction
============

Code salad is a place where I put more or less interesting pieces of python
code and illustrate the reasoning and motivation behind them. 
In a way, it is a reminder to myself and a graveyard for ideas without a
useful application (yet).

Please feel free to add your own thoughts and code and open a PR! 
Don't let all those ideas and knowledge go to waste.
 
For now, everything needs to be added manually, but that shouldn't be too much
of a problem - create a folder, put your code and the index.rst (or .md or whatever) 
there and link it here from the README.
